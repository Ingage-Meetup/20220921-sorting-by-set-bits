# Sorting by Set Bits

Given an array of 32-bit integers, sort the array in ascending order of the number of set bits (the number of 1s in the binary representation). Note the solution must sort the array in place.

If two numbers have the same number of set bits, use the integer value to determine the order.

e.g. Given [7, 6, 15, 8]
- 7 has 3 set bits (000…0111)
- 6 has 2 set bits (000…0110)
- 15 has 4 set bits (000…1111)
- 8 has 1 set bit (000…1000)

Test data: [3, 8, 3, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1] => [1, 8, 3, 3, 5, 6, 9, 7]




## Project Templates

See solutions in different languages in the "Templates" directory. Once you decide which language you'd like to use,
simply open that directory in your favorite IDE, and you should be able to run the included unit tests "out of the box".

The recommended IDEs are as follows, but feel free to use whatever IDE you are comfortable with.

-   [C#](Templates/C#) - [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
-   [Java](Templates/Java) - [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) (Community Edition is fine)
-   [JavaScript](Templates/JavaScript) - [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   [Kotlin](Templates/Kotlin) - [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) (Community Edition is fine)
